            <h2>Three Ground Rules</h2>
            <div class="rule">
                <h3>1. Zero evidence = zero credibility</h3>
                <p>If a claim has no data, no mechanism, no observable effects, and no predictive power, it doesn’t earn belief. It doesn’t even earn attention.</p>
                <ul class="pill-list">
                    <li>No data</li>
                    <li>No mechanism</li>
                    <li>No observable effects</li>
                    <li>No predictive power</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="rule">
                <h3>2. Speculative metaphysics isn’t neutral — it’s distracting</h3>
                <p>These narratives pull people out of the present, out of their agency, and out of their real life — into fear, fantasy, or dissociation.</p>
                <ul class="pill-list">
                    <li>Out of the present</li>
                    <li>Out of agency</li>
                    <li>Out of real life</li>
                    <li>Into fear, fantasy, or dissociation</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note">Instead of helping people act, grow, or understand here, now.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rule">
                <h3>3. The universe’s actual rules are few — and even those are flexible</h3>
                <p>The only “contracts” we can point to in the universe are things like gravity and the speed of light — and even those turn out to be more negotiable than we once thought.</p>

                    <h3>Does it have evidence?</h3>
                    <p>Not vibes. Not anecdotes. Not “someone said.” Actual, observable, testable grounding. If not → discard.</p>

                    <h3>Does it keep you in reality, or pull you out of it?</h3>
                    <p>A valid idea should anchor you, sharpen you, and help you operate in the world you actually inhabit. If it pulls you into abstraction, fear, or cosmic fantasy → it’s harmful.</p>
